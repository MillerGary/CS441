# Multicasting Communication Diagram and Description

+ Gary Miller

Multicasting is an approach to establishing a client server connection, when there are multiple clients and their location is generally unkown. This differs from unicasting, because the server sends out a message to any client that is in range an listening, opposed unicasting is less realistic because it is a form of point to point communcation and requires the location of each client ot be known. Multicasting can is analogous to shouting in a room, whoever is can hear the message is capable of listening. This is done by establishing a multicast group, which takes the messages sent by the server and sends them out to anyone client that wants to listen. The clients are then capable of establishing a connection to the server through the mutlicast group, and effectively exchange messages between itself and the client. This concept is visually depcited in Figure I.
